<h2 id="design-pack">Design pack</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/architecture-old-folders/documents/design-pack.docx">Design pack, with example diagrams</a></li>
  <li><a href="/architecture-old-folders/documents/design-pack-just-text.docx">Design pack, text only</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A design pack provides an overview of the scope, deliverables and complexities of implementing change in an IT system landscape. It should provide enough information for all interested or required parties to understand the changes needed and any new or improved functionality which the change will deliver. It should be useful in any delivery context, be that a digital, data or technology service.</p>

<p>Above all, a design pack should move the design process forward, enabling effective review and assurance of impending change. It should be a living, breathing artefact that is continually updated by the project or service team, in collaboration with an Design Lead.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that this document should be used as a template and adapted as necessary. Only certain views are necessary in order to ensure effective governance and assurance against IT strategy and technical standards.</p>

<p>You must discuss the development of a design pack with your <a href="../../profession/our-profession-offer/#Design-leads">Design Lead</a> and adapt appropriately.</p>

<h2 id="our-boards-and-assurance-forums">Our boards and assurance forums</h2>

<p>We provide governance and assurance of Design and design at the conceptual, logical and physical stages.</p>

<p><img src="../images/Design-governance-2019.png" alt="Image of DfE Design governance" /></p>

<h3 id="conceptual-options-and-design-peer-review">Conceptual options and design peer review</h3>
<p>All programmes / projects should complete a conceptual design pack (including options analysis) which will be peer reviewed by at least two Enterprise Design and relevant stakeholders. Any resulting decisions and actions will be logged on the Design RAID log and added to the weekly Design communications.</p>

<h3 id="logical-design-assurance">Logical design assurance</h3>
<p>Your <a href="../../profession/our-profession-offer/#Design-leads">Design Lead</a> will work with you to confirm if any Design change is significant (novel or contentious) and should therefore be reviewed at ARB, or if a peer review is sufficient.</p>

<h4 id="design-review-board-arb">Design Review Board (ARB)</h4>
<p>The ARB is the central Design governance board for significant Design change. Its scope includes DfE’s Executive Agencies and, where appropriate, Arms Length Bodies (ALBs).</p>

<p>To attend ARB you should complete and submit an ARB passport. This helps lead the discussion at the board and a design pack with the conceptual/ logical design sections completed.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/architecture-old-folders/documents/arb-passport.vsdx">ARB passport</a></li>
  <li><a href="/architecture-old-folders/documents/design-pack.docx">Design pack, with example diagrams</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The board’s purpose is to:​</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make enterprise-level decisions that are aligned with DfE and Data, Digital and Technology strategies and standards</li>
  <li>Inform and assure digital, data and technology choices</li>
  <li>Maintain oversight of design assurance through service delivery</li>
  <li>Break down siloed working to bring about consistency and clarity in design</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="peer-review-logical">Peer review (logical)</h4>
<p>This is arranged by the Design practice for projects where the Design change is minimal.</p>

<p>A design pack with the conceptual / logical design sections completed is required.</p>

<h3 id="physical-design-assurance">Physical design assurance</h3>
<p>Physical design assurance ensures proportionate review of your technical designs takes place. Your <a href="../../profession/our-profession-offer/#Design-leads">Design Lead</a> will work with you to agree the most appropriate route to review and endorse your physical design, which may involve one or more of the following activities:</p>

<h4 id="technical-design-authority-tda">Technical Design Authority (TDA)</h4>
<p>TDA considers and approves physical designs. The membership includes Design and technical specialists from different domains, including representation from IT Security Assurance, Cloud Operations and IT Service Management.</p>

<p>To attend TDA, you must submit a completed <a href="/architecture-old-folders/documents/security-checklist.xlsx">security checklist</a> and a <a href="/architecture-old-folders/documents/design-pack.docx">design pack</a> with the conceptual, logical and physical design sections completed.</p>

<h4 id="how-to-engage-the-tda">How to engage the TDA</h4>

<ul>
  <li>You will need to complete a Design pack (Physical views)</li>
  <li>You will need to complete the TDA Security Checklist</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Will the solution be hosted in the cloud? If so, has your submission been reviewed by the Cloud Infrastructure Platform (CIP) team?   (Provide name)
        - Have you considered the longer term hosting costs, across all environments? Have these cost been endorsed by the CIP team?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the Total Costof Ownership (TCO) for this service? (Delivery plus on-going operational costs from discovery to live)
      - Is this affordable?</p>
  </li>
  <li>Is there a support model in place to avoid creating long term reliance on specific individuals?</li>
  <li>What potential commoncomponents will this solution create for reuse across other parts of DfE and government?</li>
  <li>Send this to your Design Lead for peer review. They will confirm when and if this should be reviewed by TDA.</li>
  <li>When the Design Lead confirms, send your submission, security checklist and the answers to the questions above to the Design Profession mailbox by 09:00am Monday, for consideration at the Wednesday session.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="technical-show-and-tells">Technical Show and Tells</h4>
<p>It may be more appropriate for your project to bring Design and team members together for a technical Show and Tell. These are a great way to provide support, challenge and design assurance in a less formal setting. As with other assurance activities, any resulting decisions and actions will be logged on the Design RAID log and added to the weekly Design communications.</p>

<h4 id="peer-review-physical">Peer review (physical)</h4>
<p>If there is a very minor change to a design or the solution is not complex, then a peer review with Design and technical specialists may be a more appropriate way of reviewing the change. Your <a href="../../profession/our-profession-offer/#Design-leads">Design Lead</a> will help ensure this takes place.</p>
