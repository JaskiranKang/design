# DfE Design
This site documents the Design principles, standards and guidance that we expect teams working
within the [Department for Education (DfE)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education)
to follow when designing services.

It complements the [GDS Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual) and its
[design section](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design),
which covers service and interaction design more broadly.
