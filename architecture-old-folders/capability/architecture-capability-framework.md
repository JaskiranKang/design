# Design Capability Framework

> This page is being drafted, but we wanted to share the information we'd gathered as soon as it was available. If you have any comments, please contact the [Design profession](mailto:Design.profession@education.gov.uk))

## Purpose
This framework provides an outline of the roles, skills and experience that Design working within DfE have or would like to build.

It describes the pathways into Design and how to develop an Design career. It should help also people interacting with Design understand what we do and how we do it.

It builds on the [GOV.UK DDaT Capability Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-profession-capability-framework), extending the various skills, levels and mastery for the context of DfE.

## The skills and experience you'll need
In DfE, we have a mix of enterprise, solution, technical and data Design. We also have tech leads and a Head of Profession - there are lots of different roles and teams that do Design in one way or another, across a number of business areas.

Here are some of the more common roles:

### Enterprise Design

Enterprise Design work across the DfE at a strategic level to translate business strategy into change and technical delivery.

Their responsibilities include:

- establishing the Design principles, policies and standards
- assuring technology decisions are aligned to Design and technical strategies
- ownership of Design strategy and roadmaps, including ‘as-is’ and ‘to-be’ transitional states
- understanding DfE's ecosystem and its inter-dependencies

### Solution Design

Solution Design work with multi-disciplinary teams to find the best use of data, applications and technology to design and deliver services and products, whilst also delivering business change and achieving organisational objectives.

Solution Design own the overall technical vision for a solution or set of solutions. They work within service delivery teams to assure the implementation and delivery of those solutions. There are also Solution Design who work in service teams and / or directorates (e.g. ESFA) that tend to be long term assignments.

### Technical Design

Technical Design are embedded within a multi-disciplinary team, working end-to-end to help to design and implement technical solutions. They are often specialists or technical subject matter experts in one or more disciplines (e.g. software development, data, security, DevOps). They tend to work in continuous delivery environments and are comfortable with turning business problems into technical design. They tend to be from a software development or engineering background and are comfortable using technical toolsets and / or code.

Technical Design currently work in digital service lines within DfE, such as those found in Teacher Services, for example. This role is aligned to the [Technical Designer](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/technical-Designer) job family of the GOV.UK DDaT Capability Framework.

### Specialist Design

We also have [Data Design](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-Designer-role-description/data-Designer-role-description)
and other [Specialist Technical Design](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/technical-specialist-Designer-role-description/technical-specialist-Designer-role-description) (focused on things like security or networks, for example), who work closely with service delivery teams and the other parts of the department to help achieve our goals.

### Profession support

We also have an Design practice and community manager and some professional support, to keep everything running smoothly.

### Community

There is a thriving Design community in DfE. We meet up monthly, to 'show and tell' good things that are happening in Design and hear from wider Government, private sector, relevant suppliers and vendors on new, innovative solutions. And to just chat and share knowledge. You don't have to be an Designer to join in - we often hear updates from business areas and those interested in what we're doing. If you want to get involved or have something to share, drop us a line in the [Design profession](mailto:Design.profession@education.gov.uk).
