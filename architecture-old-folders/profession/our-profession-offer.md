# Our Profession Offer

> DfE Design is moving to a more profession-led model. This content is under review. Contact the [Design profession](mailto:Design.profession@education.gov.uk) for more information.

The Design profession can help you find or access the right type of Design support for your project.
We have access to a large community of permanent and contract Design across the Department, plus commercial frameworks to help fulfill your needs.

In the first instance, you should discuss your needs with your Design Lead.

## Design Leads

Design Leads work within a DfE group or portfolio of work (e.g. ESFA, EYSG or SCMD). They work closely with DDaT business partners and other DDaT specialists to support, signpost and help join-up delivery.

They:

- assist, advise and guide programmes and projects, ensuring alignment with:
  - technical strategies, including reuse of common components, patterns and standards
  - Design principles
  - Design governance and design assurance
- should be engaged from idea conception and throughout delivery
- can help identify Design and resources needed to support delivery:
  - guiding idea formation and supporting recruitment of the right Design to meet those needs Â 
  - working with a service delivery team to align with Design principles and governance,
  - helping identify commonality across the enterprise and finding the right solutions

To find out who your Design Lead is, contact the [Design profession](mailto:Design.profession@education.gov.uk)

## Help to find an Designer

The Design profession will work with you and your Design Lead to fulfill your needs. That could be assigning an Designer from our team to your project or helping you bring in the right people or services, through one of our compliant commercial routes to market. This will enable you to:
- get the right Design skills, at the right time, at the right price
- on-board Design into DfE properly, so they understand our ways of working and our governance framework
- provide oversight and assurance of their outputs and deliverables
- link them into the wider DfE Design profession and community
